<h1>Morse Code</h1>

<P>This program teaches you to receive Morse code. It starts with a
few letters and adds more when it sees that you are ready.
The program won't teach you to send code
except that sending is easy to learn on your own once you know how
the letters sound.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Set the <b>Speed</b> fast enough that letters sound like a single sound,
not a sequence of dots and dashes. Adjust the <b>Tone</b> to a pitch
that you find pleasing.

<p>Click in the text field to start the program sending. It will send one
letter and then wait for you to type it. It ignores wrong answers and
does not penalize you for guessing. If you don't type the right letter
the program will eventually show you the letter and send
it again. Let it do this a few times to learn a new letter. Press
the <B>Enter</B> key to pause, and again to resume.

<p>The program shows in black the letters it has chosen for your practice.
Letters it is saving show in gray. The length of the blue bars indicate
how much emphasis the program gives each letter.

<H1>Learn Quickly</H1>

<p>You will enjoy learning the code more if you do it quickly. You will need
determination that lasts for a week or two. These tips will help you learn faster.

<ul>
<LI>Spend at least an hour in every practice session. Let the program start
from scratch each time. Show it what you still know. </LI>

<LI>Rest for at least 15 minutes in peace and quiet when you are done.
Your mind has to consolidate what you've learned. Other activity will interfere.
</LI>

<LI>Use the program at least once a week but no more than once a day. My
wife learned the code in four sessions in as many days. </LI>

<LI>The program sends characters quickly but with all the
space between letters you need. Expect to average at about 5 words per minute. That is good
enough for all ham licenses. Use tapes or on-the-air practice if you want go faster. </LI>
</ul>
