Bugs:

  5. Register icon with WM.  I am not motivated to fix this since FLWM
       doesn't display icons like the more popular WMs.  Someone must
       repeatedly nag me to fix it.
  6. Help file (currently "nm.htm") is unlikely to be located if its not in 
       the "pwd".  I don't have a clue how this can be done portably.
  7. In cw.pyx, cw.set() doesn't check the value returned from set_cw().
